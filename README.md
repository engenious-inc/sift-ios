# Sift-iOS

Sift is an ultimate test sharding solution for iOS XCTestand XCUITest. Unlike sequential run, sharded run uses the advantage of parallelism. SIFT splits the test suite into the desired number of splits, each shard having approximately the same number of test cases. All shards are executed in parallel on all connected nodes, each node having multiple simulators or emulators.
